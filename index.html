‘COVID-19’ the word we have been hammered past one year. This global pandemic
has affected over 136 million people worldwide and still continues. But every set
back is a setup for a comeback. This world crisis have proved that nothing is more
important than one's well. Being healthy is a real wealth neither money nor pieces of
gold or silver. <br><br>

There were cases of patients who had a lot of wealth but didn’t have a
single garland at their funeral, then what is the point in running behind money by
ignoring health. According to WHO Individuals with pre-existing disorders like
diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, respiratory issues are at higher risk
of having COVID-19 as compared to people with robust immunity.

This pandemic has given us a valuable lesson of heading towards more self-care
and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Being healthy doesn’t only imply building
physic but following a good diet, beings mentally fit, building immunity also counts
equally. Take smaller steps every day start with light exercise 20-30 minutes, eat
fresh unprocessed food, stay hydrated, cut the amounts of fats, oil, and sugar, don’t
compromise on sleep. According to a survey COVID-19 itself can lead to
neurological and mental complications. As soon as you feel that depression is
kicking in…..
MOVE….                                                  
MOVE , TAKE A BREAK.…..
Go outside and run around, dance, exercise, move your arms all weird like a jellyfish…… 
IDC how you do it but just move and vibes with nature. Let your heart
race and your soul feel the freedom.

<h5>Life is a novel each chapter is written every day</h5>
<img src="./novel.jpg" alt="novel" class="novel img"><br><br>
We as humans have faced a lot of challenges in this pandemic. Some lost theirs loved
ones while some went through the financial crisis, but somewhere or the other everyone
made a stronger comeback. People started giving importance to self and public
hygiene, while more medical facilities have been developed, also the government
has started investing more in public health systems. Many people acquired new skills
and also revived their lost hobbies. Social media was flooded with ‘Dalgona coffee’
and homemade cakes. The number of COVID patients was rising and there was a
fearful atmosphere around, which brought everyone more closer. People have
started valuing their families and friends by keeping all the grudges at the bay.

<h5>Life can’t be piece of cake every time</h5>Life can’t be a piece of cake every time. We have to appreciate ourselves and
everything around us. BE GRATEFUL.
It is normal to come across obstacles, that’s how we grow when we overcome
challenges. More people across the world are now rapidly adopting healthier food
options with a focus on increasing immunity and maintaining mental health. This is
indeed a silver lining which the pandemic has given to our life.
